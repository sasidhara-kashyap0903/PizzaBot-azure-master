# Microsoft Azure Pizza Chatbot
## Objective
Objective
In this project, I would be using QnA Maker Service to make a Chatbot that orders your favourite food like Pizzas, Cakes, Ice Creams and Garlic Bread. It provides rating facility through the given form.
## Problem Statement
Develop a Chatbot for Pizza that greets the customer, provides the menu to choose from the given menu, orders your favorite food from the given digit typed by the customer and provides rating facility through the given form.
## Problem Context
The purpose of chat bots is to support and scale business teams in their relations with customers. It could live in any major chat applications like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages. Chatbot applications streamline interactions between people and services, enhancing customer experience. At the same time, they offer companies new opportunities to improve the customers engagement process and operational efficiency by reducing the typical cost of customer service. This project is focussed on building a custom chatbot that will be your fundamental step of the learning curve of building your own professional chatbots. But you must be tired of the weird chat bots out there in the world which are made for business purposes? In this project, we would be building an extensive Chatbot service, to which you can talk. And talking to a chatbot would not be business driven. It would just be casual conversations. Collaborating with these types of APIs is very much critical as in today's world the popular chatbots do much more than simply having a data-driven conversation; to supplement additional user-oriented features.
## What is a Microsoft Azure QnA Maker Service?
QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data. It is used to find the most appropriate answer for any input from your custom knowledge base (KB) of information.
QnA Maker is commonly used to build conversational client applications, which include social media applications, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop applications.
QnA Maker does not store customer data. All customer data (question answers and chat logs) is stored in the region the customer deploys the dependent service instances in. For more details on dependent services see here.
This documentation contains the following article types:
•	The quickstarts are step-by-step instructions that let you make calls to the service and get results in a short period of time.
•	The how-to guides contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.
•	The conceptual articles provide in-depth explanations of the service's functionality and features.
•	Tutorials are longer guides that show you how to use the service as a component in broader business solutions.
When to use QnA Maker
•	When you have static information - Use QnA Maker when you have static information in your knowledge base of answers. This knowledge base is custom to your needs, which you've built with documents such as PDFs and URLs.
•	When you want to provide the same answer to a request, question, or command - when different users submit the same question, the same answer is returned.
•	When you want to filter static information based on meta-information - add metadata tags to provide additional filtering options relevant to your client application's users and the information. Common metadata information includes chit-chat, content type or format, content purpose, and content freshness.
•	When you want to manage a bot conversation that includes static information - your knowledge base takes a user's conversational text or command and answers it. If the answer is part of a pre-determined conversation flow, represented in your knowledge base with multi-turn context, the bot can easily provide this flow.
